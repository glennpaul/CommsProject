# CommsProject
4th Year Engineering Project - P2P Conferencing Software

How to run project:
  - create project in eclipse
  - copy files from repo to project folder
  - right click project -> build path -> add external archives -> add all jar files in lib folder
  - open and run combined.java
  
  
Note:
  What combined.java does is it records video (actually just a list of images) and audio (as a byte array) then plays both. Once you run combined.java, a window will pop up. Once the program has recorded some video and audio (about 5 seconds), it will open a second window that shows the video. Make sure you move the first window so you can see it.
